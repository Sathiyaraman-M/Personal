## Overview

The project was done as a part of the Glance Village hackathon.  The project is a fingerprint-based attendance system for MGNREGA workers. 

Our solution is a comprehensive technology-based system that leverages modern technologies such as mobile location tracking, biometric authentication, and cloud hosting to address the shortcomings of the existing MNREGA scheme.

The system comprises of a mobile-based attendance tracking app for workers and a desktop application for government officials. The attendance tracking app uses GPS location data and biometric authentication to accurately record worker attendance at their respective work sites.

The desktop application enables government officials to create, approve, and update job cards, as well as track work progress in real-time. The integration of Aadhaar authentication and biometric verification ensures that every major action by government officials requires proper authentication, reducing the potential for fraud and errors in the MNREGA scheme.

The system can be hosted on cloud infrastructure, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution that can be easily deployed across a large number of districts and states. Overall, our solution offers a more efficient and transparent method of implementing the MNREGA scheme, leading to improved accountability, reduced administrative burden, and better outcomes for MNREGA workers.
