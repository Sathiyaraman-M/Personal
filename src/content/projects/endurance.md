## Overview

This project is a simple Library Management System built using Blazor WebAssembly, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and SQL Server. It uses Clean Architecture principles to build a loosely coupled application that is easy to maintain and extend. The application allows users to browse for books, add them to the cart, and then complete an order. The application also implements an administration area that allows authorized users to add new books and categories, and edit existing ones. The application also implements a elaborate authentication and authorization system using ASP.NET Core Identity.
